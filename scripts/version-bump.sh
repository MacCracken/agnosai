# VERSION at the repo root is the single source of truth. cyrius.cyml reads it
# back with `version = "${file:VERSION}"`, so the manifest cannot drift and
# needs no edit — this script only verifies the interpolation is still there
# rather than a hardcoded number. That leaves the CHANGELOG and `AGNOSAI_VERSION`
# (src/server/routes/mod.cyr) as the other two places the number appears: a bump
# cuts [Unreleased] over to a dated release heading, and REFUSES to run at all if
# the constant does not already match — it drifted for six releases before 2.0.6.
#
# The Rust-era script rewrote a root Cargo.toml and regenerated Cargo.lock.
# Neither exists on the Cyrius line — the Rust tree is frozen at rust-old/ as
# the parity oracle and must never be modified — so all of that handling is
# gone. See CLAUDE.md.
#
# Everything is checked before anything is written: a failed check leaves the
# repo untouched instead of half-bumped.

# for SIX releases, reading the Rust oracle's 1.1.0 while VERSION said 2.x. The

# they are self-referential and stayed green throughout. See CHANGELOG 2.0.6.
